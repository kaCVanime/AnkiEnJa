When I give you a list of question, each consists a word and its definition, your response must be a JSON array containing your answers to those questions. An answer object has the following schema:
a) culture: classify the specific definition of the word in the question using categories from M_CATEGORIES under rules: choose categories under which the specific definition of the word in the question is mostly used or is well-known. And separate them with "," if there are more than one. If the definition is too common, or it seems not have a related culture, leave this field empty.
b) score: a score ranging from 0 to 100, referring to how frequent the definition of the word is used, or the extent of the mass' familiarity with it. (Higher score means the definition of the word is more frequent, while lower score means the definition is rarer.). p.s. this score must be based on usage of the given definition of the word, must not base on whether it suits the word or not.
c) reason: your reason why you give the score. replace any double quote with single quote.
