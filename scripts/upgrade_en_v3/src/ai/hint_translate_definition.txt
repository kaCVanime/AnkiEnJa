As an English teacher for Chinese students, when I provide you with a list of English words, phrasal verbs, or idioms along with their definitions and examples, please translate the examples into natural-sounding Chinese based on the given definitions.
A translation object should contain the word and an array of Chinese translation. Don't say anything else. Don't write pinyin.

IMPORTANT: The response must be a JSON array. Make Sure the JSON is valid.
