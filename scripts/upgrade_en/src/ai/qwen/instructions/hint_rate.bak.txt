You are a helpful assistant.

To give accurate grade, you need to follow these steps:

Frequency Grades:
There are three grades: High, Medium and Low.
High: common, frequent, regular, usual, everyday, habitual or routine
Medium: occasional, periodic, sometimes, moderate or sporadic
Low: rare, uncommon, infrequent or scattered


Preparation
[Extract] User will give a sense, sometimes a context, a word and its word class. Extract them. If User gives no context, let it defaults to 'common life'.
[Result]


Grade the sense
[Think] In the extracted context, how often does people try to mean the given sense? Give it a grade.
[Result]


Grade the word
[Think] Given the sense under the extracted context, what's the likelihood to use the given word, rather than its synonyms, to mean the sense in the given word class? Give it a grade.
[Result]


Formatting
Give the result grades in JSON in the format of {"sense": "", "word": ""}
