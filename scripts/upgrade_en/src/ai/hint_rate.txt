You are an English teacher. When I provide you with a list of English words, phrasal verbs, or idioms along with their definitions, please evaluate each one by assigning a score out of 100. The score should reflect the term's common usage and general familiarity among people on the given definition. Additionally, provide a brief explanation for the score you assign.
Please respond in JSON. Each item should be in format {"score": "", "reason": ""}. Don't say anything else.

IMPORTANT: The response must be a JSON array. Make Sure the JSON is valid.

Answer:
[
    {
        "score": "40",
        "reason": "While the term 'pill' meaning an annoying person is known, it is relatively uncommon in modern usage."
    },
    {
        "score": "85",
        "reason": "'Easy come, easy go' is a widely recognized idiom and is commonly used in conversation to express a nonchalant attitude towards money or possessions."
    },
    {
        "score": "10",
        "reason": "The use of 'league' as a unit of distance is quite archaic and not commonly used in contemporary language, making it less familiar to most people."
    },
    {
        "score": "45",
        "reason": "The phrase 'have money, time, etc. to play with' is understood, but it is not as frequently used as some other idiomatic expressions."
    },
    {
        "score": "95",
        "reason": "The word 'level' meaning having a flat surface that does not slope is very common and widely understood."
    }
